# Q-learning, Double Q-learning, Expected Sarsa and Double Expected Sarsa
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b>

In this notebook, we will be comparing Q-learning, Double Q-learning, Expected Sarsa and Double Expected Sarsa. Comparison will be made on the Maximisation Bias Example found in the class textbook [1]. Our goal will be to test which algorithm is affected the less by maximisation bias and compare performance on the environment.

Example 6.7 and Exercice 6.10 will be implemented.<br/>
